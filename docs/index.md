# opensearch Provider





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `base_url` (String, Sensitive) The Opensearch base url

### Optional

- `disable_authentication` (Boolean) In all production environments, authentication is expected but with this flag it can be disabled for example for the purpose of local testing
- `path_prefix` (String) prefix to be prepended to any path. The default is '/_dashboards' to prevent breaking change since this is needed for AWS Opensearch on which this provider was first used. You will want to set this to an empty string for development on a local Opensearch for example
- `sync_index_pattern_fields` (Boolean) Usually in index-patterns the fields are automatically generated from the matched indices. If you instead explicitly want to track index-pattern-fields with terraform, set this value to true.
